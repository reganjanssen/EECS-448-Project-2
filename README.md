<h2> Welcome to Battleship!</h2>
<small> This game allows for players to choose whether they would like to play against a computer opponent or a friend. It then allows the player to choose the number of ships to play with (1-6), and asks the player(s) to place the ships. After all ships have been placed, players will take turns attacking their opponents ships. Attacks are sent by typing in the coordinate of the desired attack, if playing against the computer attacks are sent after player 1 sends their attacks. While playing the game, players will have the ability to view their own board as well as the ability to view the attacks that they have sent on the opponents board. Once a player or computer has sunk all of the other players ships, the game will end and the program stops running.</small>
<h2> AI Requirements:</h2>
<small> For the AI component there will be three levels of difficulty. All AI will place their ships randomly with a legal ship placement.</small>
<ol><li>Easy: It just fires randomly every turn.</li>
  <li>Medium: It fires randomly until it hits a ship then fires in orthogonally adjacent spaces to find other hits until a ship is sunk.</li>
  <li>Hard: Cheater, cheater pumpkin eater! This mode knows where all your ships are and lands a hit every turn.</li></ol>
